Sujith's Final year Project

A detailed explanation of project description, breaking down each part for better understanding:

🔍 
What the Project Does


This project is a web-based application that turns an uploaded image into a poetic or descriptive text using AI. It mimics how a human might look at a picture and creatively describe or write about it.

🖼️ 
Frontend
User uploads an image through the frontend (built with React and TypeScript).

The frontend sends this image to the backend via an API request.

🧠 
Backend (FastAPI + Python)


Once the image reaches the backend:

YOLOv8 (a CNN - Convolutional Neural Network)

Detects and labels objects in the image (like car, person, dog, etc.).

It’s fast and accurate for real-time object detection.

CLIP model (Vision Transformer)

Understands the context or scene of the image.

It’s not just about “what’s in the image” but “what’s happening or what the image feels like.”

🎨 
Prompt Creation
Based on the object labels (from YOLO) and scene (from CLIP), your code generates a creative prompt.

Example:

“Write a poem that describes a busy street filled with people, cars, and neon lights at night.”

This prompt is sent to ChatGPT API (GenAI).

✍️ 
Text Generation
ChatGPT processes the prompt and responds with a poem or creative text based on the image.

The generated text is then returned to the frontend and shown to the user.
